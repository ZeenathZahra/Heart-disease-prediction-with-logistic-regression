## Problem Definition

Heart disease is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. It is characterized by the build-up of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can restrict blood flow to the heart and increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.

Predicting heart disease using machine learning can help healthcare professionals identify individuals at risk of developing heart disease and take preventive measures to reduce the risk. Machine learning algorithms can analyze various data points, such as medical history, demographic data, and lifestyle factors, to make predictions about an individual's likelihood of developing heart disease.

There are several approaches to predicting heart disease using machine learning. One approach is to use supervised learning, in which a machine learning model is trained on a dataset that includes labeled examples of individuals with and without heart disease. The model can then use this information to predict the likelihood of heart disease in new, unlabeled cases.
